How to build:
  Note: 
    make sure your python version is 2.x
    if your python version is 3.x , run this command to install python2 and symbolic link python2.7 to python:
      sudo apt-get install python2 -y
      sudo ln /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python

  make sure you know your divece's code and android version, then clone this git like:
    git clone https://github.com/adontoo/android_kernel_samsung_kernelsu.git -b bloomq/13 bloomq/13
  run build_kernel.sh from kernel source rood dir like:
    ./build_kernel.sh

  you will get a kernel image from kernel source dir(out/arch/arm64/boot/Image)when kernel build finish.
    unpack boot.img from firmware or pull it from your phone, rename Image file to boot.img-kernel
    and replace it to unpack boot.img dir: split_img/boot.img-kernel, repack boot.img at last.

  go to twrp flash the repacked boot.img or tar the boot.img and flash it from odin tool.

  have fun!
